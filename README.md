# Daily Data

This is an attempt at doing some sort of visualization, data processing, wrangling, munging and so on on a daily/every other day/weekly/whenever time permits basis. I will be using R, Python, D3 or whatever can help me get the job done or gives me a chance to learn something new. 

This repository acts as a store for all such explorations. 

Godspeed.
